SPHERES, TIME AND DISTANCES

Moons: size 30°, tidal locked with Planet, Revolution in 6 days (Planet time)
Sun: size 3°.
Planet : tidal locked with Sun.
Day / Sun cycle: by solar eclispes. Hours and Degrees are the same. 1 Day is 60 hours, 1 Hour is 60 Minutes / 1°, 1 Minute is 60 Seconds.
  1 Hour is equivalent to the Moons moving 1° in the sky.
  24 Hours are Night (eclispe).
  3 Hours are Dawn and Dusk.
  30 Hours are Day.
  The hottest hour is just before Dusk, the coldest just before Dawn.

6 Days per Week => 1 Week is 360°, Moons Revolution.
5 Weeks per Month => 30°, 
12 Months per Year => 360°, Planet Revolution.

1 Meter is the distance of 1'' (second of arc) of a Moon circonference (form the center) => MoonR = 648 000/π
and also the distance of 1'' / 30 of the Planet circonference => PlanetR = 19 440 000/π
MoonR = 206 264,8062471 m
PlanetR = 6 187 944,1874129 m

For comparison: 
EarthMoonR = 1 737 000 m
EarthR = 6 371 000 m 

WARNING: The Terran Metter and the Planet Metter are NOT the same. The Planet Metter should be more or less beetween 0.8 and 1.2 Earth Metter, but we don't know more than that.
(Earth and the Planet have more or less the same composition, so we can directly link gravity to volume (4/3*πR^3).
The Planet must have a gravity pull beetween 0.5G and 1.5G).

SunR and Sun - Planet distance: Irrelevant, but it appears as 1° from the Planet surface.

Planet - Moons distance: The Moons appeae as 20° from the Planet surface, and moonR = 648 000/π, so D = 30*π/180 * moonR 
D = 60 * 648 000
D = 38 880 000 m
